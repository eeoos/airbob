# AWS Performance Lab — Phase 0 Application Contracts

## Current status

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Redis general/cache endpoint fail-fast | Implemented |
| Same-image accommodation cache toggle | Implemented |
| External Toss/Google/Slack/S3 side-effect block | Implemented |
| Scheduler/Kafka isolated-read policy | Implemented |
| Terraform foundation/lab | Not implemented yet |
| Route 53 cutover | Not executed |
| AWS performance evidence | Not collected |

Phase 0 supplies application contracts only. It does not create AWS resources, apply Terraform, migrate authoritative DNS, change Route 53 traffic, or establish performance results.

## Application profile matrix

```text
integrated-smoke: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=aws,performance-lab
isolated-read:    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=aws,traffic-benchmark
```

`integrated-smoke` retains the application's internal scheduler and Kafka flow while blocking external Toss, Google, Slack, and ordinary S3 write side effects. `isolated-read` adds the scheduler and Kafka listener isolation policy. `application-traffic-benchmark.yaml` includes `performance-lab` through a Spring profile group, so it also inherits the external side-effect block.

## Redis and cache experiment boundary

The lab topology remains exactly two Redis containers/endpoints: general Redis and dedicated accommodation-detail cache Redis. The `performance-lab` profile fails startup if those endpoints resolve to the same normalized host and port.

For the same-image cache A/B experiment, change only `ACCOMMODATION_DETAIL_CACHE_ENABLED=true|false`. When disabled, accommodation-detail cache reads and eviction bypass the cache clients; the two-endpoint topology remains configured.

Cache reset means `FLUSHDB` on the dedicated accommodation-detail cache Redis only. It must not flush the general Redis, which holds general application data such as sessions and locks. No HTTP cache-reset endpoint exists.
